<h3>About Project</h3>
<p>
    During the pandemic period, I applied for a tech team.
    I had to solve one problem statement to pass the recruitment process.
    So, this project was based on that problem statement.
    It includes <b>ROS+Gazebo simulations</b> along with mechanical design.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
    The Robot is launched in an unknown apartment, it has to find the passcode of safe which is located in the same
    apartment. The digits of passcode are written on walls at different locations robot has to recognize this digits and
    decode the passcode, the hint for passcode sequence is 1st digit is red, 2nd is green, 3rd is yellow, 4th is blue
    and 5th is orange. Once bot decodes the passcode and saves, it has to search for safe and press the keys for
    unlocking the safe!
    <br>
    <u><b>But, here is the catch ! </b></u>: Safe is at 100cm and appartment is armed with lasers which will detect any
    thing above
    50cm. So, our bot design should be in a such way that it will have height less than 50cms and will be able to extend
    itself upto 100cms !

<h3>Here is how our bot looks!</h3>
