        This team focuses on Aerial robots related competition in worldwide.
        It has already participated in IARC Mission 7 and Barcelona Smart Drone challenge.
        Currently, it is focusing on IARC Mission 9. The detailed problem statement for IARC Mission 9 can be found <a
                href="http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/" target="blank">here</a>.
        Current major tasks are to travel 3 miles of distance and perform the task of replacing the communication module
        using the robotic arm on the drone </p>

<h3>My contribution : Mechatronics Subsystem</h3>
<p>My Current work is to design robotic arm with gripper for performing the tasks given in IARC Mission 9. I have made
        models for it and now working on optimizing its weight</p>
