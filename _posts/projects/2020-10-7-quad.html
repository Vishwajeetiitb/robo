<h3>Arduino Quadcopter from scratch</h3>
<p>Every engineer wishes to build a drone at least once in his life. I also dreamed about the same and took a step to
    make it totally from scratch without any readymade flight controllers.
    The motivation to build from scratch was to learn PID. I wanted to learn PID and apply it in the real-life. </p>

<h3>pid</h3>
<p>
    The basic goal of PID is to reach the desired state under given uncertainties. In case of Quadcopter there are uncertainties like wind, center of mass position, etc. You have tune PID parameters to
    obtain optimum results. From the following images, you can get an Intuitive idea of PID
