<h3>Arduino Quadcopter from scratch</h3>
<p>Every engineer wishes to build a drone at least once in his life. I also dreamed about the same and took a step to make it totally from scratch without any readymade flight controllers.
    The motivation to build from scratch was to learn PID. I wanted to learn PID and apply it in the real-life. </p>
