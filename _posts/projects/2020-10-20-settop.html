    When Everyone was at home due to pandemic of covid, Tinkerer's lab conducted a very exciting 
    competition named "How Things Work", in which participant will have to explain about working of any technical
    thing. I found old set-top box in my cupboard and I decided to explain its working. This competition 
    gave me more insight in electronics of set-top box!
