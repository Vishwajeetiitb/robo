<h3>About the Competition</h3>
<p>This Competition was held during the 8th Inter IIT Tech Meet. During this meet, different tech competitions are conducted between IITs.
    One of them was the "DIC's Terrace Farming Challenge for Hilly areas".
    The task was to design an autonomous robot that can climb steps of 40cm and perform basic farming tasks like Cutting, Plucking, etc.

<h3>Our robot model</h3>
<p>We had to come up with a design which will be compact and can perform given tasks including the climbing mechanism. after a week of brainstorming we came up with a design which includes a lead screw for the climbing mechanism and a rectangular shell around the bot which will perform the task of plowing and cutting. we also include a simple pipe with a funnel for seeding.
    This idea lead us to stood 2nd in indeation phase. 
    Here are the pictures illustrating how our bot looks like: </p>

<h3>climbing mechanism</h3>
<p>The climbing mechanism includes series of motions of lead screw and driving wheels which will cause to bot lift up and move forward.
    Following image will illustrate the overall mechanism :

    After weeks of effort, we could complete the hardware assembly a day before the competition and that's why we didn't get time for testing.
    During the competition, due to electrical failures, we could not perform tasks.
     Though we didn't win the competition the overall experience of this project was life-changing for me, 
     this Tech Meet changed my perspective of thinking in all aspects. Also, the train journey, debugging in the train, 
     finding tools at late night in place which completely unknown to us was less than an adventure!
