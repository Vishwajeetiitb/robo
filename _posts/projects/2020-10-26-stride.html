<h3>About stride</h3>
<p>Stride is the student technical team at IIT Bombay, focusing on Qudrpuped robots for manoeuvering through rough terrains</p>

<h3>My contribution</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Coded an <b>Inverse kinematics</b> algorithm on micro-controller to execute the motion of quadruped robot</li>
    <li>Designed a Controller to integrate the functionality components like grippers, pneumatic cylinders, motors, etc</li>
    <li>Created low pass filters using op-amp and RC combinations to reduce noise in signal for controlling motors</li>

</ul>
