<h3>Arduino Quadcopter from scratch</h3>
<p>Every engineer wishes to build a drone at least once in his life. I also dreamed about the same and took a step to
    make it totally from scratch without any readymade flight controllers.
    The motivation to build from scratch was to learn PID. I wanted to learn PID and apply it in the real-life. </p>
<hr>
<h3>pid</h3>
<p>
    The basic goal of PID is to reach the desired state under given uncertainties. In case of Quadcopter there are
    uncertainties like wind, center of mass position, etc. You have tune PID parameters to
    obtain optimum results. From the following images, you can get an Intuitive idea of PID

<h3>2D model approximation for PID testing</h3>

Before applying PID on the quadcopter, I had to find an alternative model that will be safer to test so that, I can play
around with it and see the response of different parameters of PID.
<br> The 2D model approximation shown in the above image is best to do that. with the help of this model, I could learn
more about PID and its parameter's response. The one more major learning was to learn how to apply filters like
<b>complementary filters, Kalman filters</b> to reduce the noise in the gyroscope due to vibrations of the frame.
you can watch the full video of the model that I made... <br>

<h3>
    <li>Failures</li>
</h3>
<p>

    As there was no one to guide me on how to make it properly, I failed too many times. Things went wrong when I
    started testing.
    I harmed my self two times, broke the frame, the battery swelled and I had to replace it 3 times
