<h3>About project</h3>
<p>After watching MARVEL movies, I dreamed of having a hammer similar to one in Ragnar thor. 
    And my engineering knowledge made that dream come true!!

<h3>Science behind it!</h3>
<p>The curious thing about a thor's hammer is that only a worthy person can pick it up. 
    In this project, that worth person is, of course, me!  &#128513; <br>
    when it is placed on metallic surface(like Iron) it will stick to it untill I touch it.
    The trick behind it is that - when it is placed on any surface the electromagnet inside the hammer gets active
    and this cause strong attractive force between hammer and metallic surface. I have a key with me 
    which turns of the electromagnet of hammer when I touch and I will be able to pick it up very easily!
