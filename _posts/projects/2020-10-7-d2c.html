<h3>About Flipkart Grid 2.0 - Robotcs Challenge</h3>
<p>During the pandemic period, Flipkart conducted an interesting competition for robotics enthusiasts under Flipkart
    Grid 2.0. There were three problem statements :
<ul>
    <li>Intelligent Picking</li>
    <li>Autonomous Indoor Drone</li>
    <li>Autonomous Stair Climbing Robot.</li>
</ul>
We chose the Autonomous Indoor Drone Challenge in which we had to propose the solution of drone which will be able to carry 2kgs of load 
and able to navigate through a series of windows placed in a room
</p>
