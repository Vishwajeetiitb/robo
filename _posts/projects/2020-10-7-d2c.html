<h3>About Flipkart Grid 2.0 - Robotcs Challenge</h3>
<p>During the pandemic period, Flipkart conducted an interesting competition for robotics enthusiasts under Flipkart
    Grid 2.0. There were three problem statements :
<ul>
    <li>Intelligent Picking</li>
    <li>Autonomous Indoor Drone</li>
    <li>Autonomous Stair Climbing Robot.</li>
</ul>
We chose the Autonomous Indoor Drone Challenge in which we had to propose the solution of drone which will be able to
carry 2kgs of load
and able to navigate through a series of windows randomly placed in a room <br> <br>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>
    I designed the cad model consisting of depth camera (for navigation and localization), computation unit (Rpi4) and
    bucket (to carry payload).
    The design was based on the contrains due to size of window through which it has to pass. <br>
    Here are some images of the design:
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<div class="row uniform 50%">
    <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/d2c/d2c1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/d2c/d2c2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/d2c/d2c3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
    After design was ready, our next step was to perform stability and structural analysis on frame of quadcopter in
    order to ensure that it will sustain
    in given conditions. At the same time team has to make a simulation of quad performing the tasks given problem
    statement.
    <br> I performed stress analysis and modal analysis on the frame using ANSYS simulation software using FEA model

<h3>Current Status of project</h3>
We cracked the simulation Challenge and now we are in national finale!!! only 3 teams got selected for finale. Our next
target is to develope actual prototype
