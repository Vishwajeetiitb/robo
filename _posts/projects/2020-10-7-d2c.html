<h3>About Flipkart Grid 2.0 - Robotcs Challenge</h3>
<p>During the pandemic period, Flipkart conducted an interesting competition for robotics enthusiasts under Flipkart
    Grid 2.0. There were three problem statements :
<ul>
    <li>Intelligent Picking</li>
    <li>Autonomous Indoor Drone</li>
    <li>Autonomous Stair Climbing Robot.</li>
</ul>
We chose the Autonomous Indoor Drone Challenge in which we had to propose the solution of drone which will be able to carry 2kgs of load 
and able to navigate through a series of windows randomly placed in a room <br> <br>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>
    I designed the cad model consisting of depth camera (for navigation and localization), computation unit (Rpi4) and bucket (to carry payload).
    The design was based on the contrains due to size of window through which it has to pass. <br>
    Here are some images of the design:
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/projects/d2c.jpg" class="image" style="max-width:50%;" alt="">
</div>
    <div class="row uniform 50%">
        <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/d2c/d2c1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
        <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/d2c/d2c2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
        <div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/projects/d2c/d2c3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    </div>
