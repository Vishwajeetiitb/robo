<h3>About the Competition</h3>
<p> 
    The agro-based industry is regarded as the sunrise sector of the Indian economy because of its large potential for growth, employment, and income generation. Farmers must meet the changing needs of our planet and the expectations of regulators, consumers, and food processors, and retailers.
     Cost-effective, eco-friendly, and easily operable agricultural bots are in demand to give a boost to the economy.</p>
