<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/projects/pat/pat.gif" alt="" /></span></p>
Patrolling means the act of walking or traveling around an area, at regular intervals, to protect or supervise it.
Given a graph, the patrolling task refers to continuously visiting all the graph nodes to minimize the time lag between
two visits.
We have to design an automated patrolling system with multiple agents to monitor a given environment with nodes of
interest of varying priorities. A group of students is working on the simulation part of this project, given by the <a
    href="https://www.drdo.gov.in/home" target="blank">DRDO, India.</a>
They will do the hardware aspect of this project. This project's main objective is to prevent the innocent lives of many
soldiers
who are at the borders working at their top edge and died while patrolling manually. So, instead of them, an autonomous
car will
do this task and keep a keen observation on the movement of enemies.

<h3>My Learnings & Contribution till date:</h3>
<p>
    <li>This project gave me an insight into Reinforcement Learning.
        I created an algorithm for decision making based on RL Techniques and tested it on platforms like MIT
        DeepTraffic Simulator and Unity ML-Agents.
        This algorithm helps in making decisions like accelerating, decelerating, left & right based on the surrounding

<li>Designed algorithm for path planning for the car at the junction of the road</li> <br>
<li>During my learning period, I applied the RL method <b>using ROS and gazebo</b> and simulated a self-balancing
    inverse pendulum,
    which learns to balance itself from previous experience</li>

<h3>Future Work:</h3>
<p>
    <li>Design the patrolling algorithm using Deep Q Network Reinforcement learning technique with GBLA architecture</li>
    <li>Incorporate the effect of priority nodes in the map while maneuvering</li>
    <li>Improve the results of Conscientious Reactive in case of larger number of cars in assymetrical grids.</li>
